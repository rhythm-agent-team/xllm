# NPU capture, export, and artifact transfer

Resolve PIDs, script paths, and run directories from the actual deployment before
running commands. Execute each command in the indicated environment; host and
container PIDs are not interchangeable. All names and paths below are examples.

## 1. Confirm the execution environment

Use the shell where the service runs. If already on the NPU server, skip SSH.
If already inside the service container, skip both SSH and container entry.
For a host deployment, skip container commands entirely.

```bash
# Only when the agent is on another machine:
ssh developer@npu-host
```

```bash
# Only when xLLM runs in a container and the current shell is on its host:
XLLM_CONTAINER=xllm-npu
sudo docker inspect "$XLLM_CONTAINER" --format '{{json .Mounts}}'
sudo docker exec -it "$XLLM_CONTAINER" bash
```

```bash
# In the service environment (server host or service container):
command -v msprof
msprof --help
ps -eo pid,ppid,args
npu-smi info
```

Identify the xLLM parent process using the process tree, launch logs, command line,
and `/proc/<pid>/exe`. Do not copy an example PID or simply select a worker PID
from `npu-smi`. Record `git remote -v`, `git branch --show-current`,
`git rev-parse HEAD`, and `git status --short` for the active checkout. When
synchronizing another checkout, compare these values and relevant uncommitted
contents too; matching HEADs alone do not prove that running code matches.
Record `python_model_path` and the hashes and build provenance of the actual
executable, native extensions, and shared libraries, separately from the source SHA.

Locate and read the deployment's launch and request scripts in the execution environment.
Treat old scripts as configuration clues: verify the executable, `python_model_path`,
and requested configuration. If the configuration is unsupported, report it and stop;
do not silently change options to obtain a trace.

The service launch environment must include `export PROFILING_MODE=dynamic`.
Verify that the launch script preserves it. If needed, inspect only that variable
in `/proc/<pid>/environ`, without printing the entire environment. Restart an
existing service without the variable only within the task's authorization.
Starting the profiler cannot repair the earlier launch configuration.

## 2. Warm up, then capture a bounded window

Send successful requests with the deployment's request script or task workload
until warmup completes. Ensure the script detects HTTP and service errors; an
error JSON returned by curl is not a successful request. Record actual input and
output lengths, concurrency, prefix-cache conditions, and early EOS behavior.

In interactive terminal A in the service PID namespace:

```bash
# Replace these example values with the verified parent PID and a unique run path.
XLLM_PARENT_PID=12345
PROFILE_RUN=/path/to/profiling/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
mkdir -p "$PROFILE_RUN"
set -o pipefail
msprof --dynamic=on --pid="$XLLM_PARENT_PID" \
  --output="$PROFILE_RUN" --model-execution=on \
  --runtime-api=on --aicpu=on 2>&1 | tee "$PROFILE_RUN/capture.log"
```

Check support for these options with the installed `msprof --help`. If unsupported,
consult documentation for that version; do not silently remove essential options
and still claim complete capture.

Wait for attachment readiness, then enter `start` in terminal A. Confirm capture
has started, run the profiling workload in terminal B where the service endpoint
is reachable, and save its output and exit status in `workload.log`. After all
profiling requests finish, enter `stop` in A, confirm capture has stopped, then
enter `quit`. Wait for msprof to exit and flush its data. Record control commands
and their times in `capture.log` or the manifest; tee may not record terminal
input. Fixed sleeps do not replace readiness checks. If a request fails, stop
this capture and retain the failure evidence.

For automation, send control commands after the corresponding stage is ready,
rather than piping them all at once. On failure, stop only this collector and
wait for exit before exporting.

## 3. Export timelines explicitly

Enumerate every `PROF_*` directory in this run, export each one, and record its
exit status:

```bash
msprof --export=on --output="$PROFILE_RUN/PROF_actual_name" \
  > "$PROFILE_RUN/export-PROF_actual_name.log" 2>&1
```

Do not select only the newest directory and discard other ranks. Find outputs:

```bash
find "$PROFILE_RUN" -type f \( -name 'msprof_*.json' \
  -o -name 'trace_view.json' -o -name '*.pt.trace.json' \)
```

A common location is `PROF_*/mindstudio_profiler_output/msprof_*.json`; older
versions may use `timeline/`. Inspect actual files instead of treating directory
existence as success. If only CSV files appear, inspect export logs and the
version's timeline export options. A `step_trace_*.json` containing only step
information does not replace a complete kernel timeline.

Retain original JSON and do not arbitrarily rescale timestamps. Chrome Trace
commonly uses an event array or an object containing `traceEvents`. Look for timed
events with `ph`, `ts`, `pid`, and `tid`. Complete slices typically use `ph=X` and
`dur`; paired `B` and `E` events are also possible. Check that the file contains
timestamped events; parsing successfully does not prove that useful data was
captured. For timeline inspection, follow [Perfetto analysis](perfetto.md).

## 4. Make artifacts accessible to the viewing machine

For a server-only run, retain the exported files and report their absolute server
paths. No download is required for command-line analysis. If the browser already
has access to those files, open them directly. Transfer is needed only when the
browser runs on a different machine without access to the trace.

Record the server path, rank, and device in the manifest. For containers,
also record the corresponding host path. A bind-mounted file is accessible from
the host; if the export is not mounted, stage only this run's artifacts there:


```bash
# Container deployment only, from its host: use the resolved container name.
sudo docker cp "$XLLM_CONTAINER:/container/path" /host/staging/path
```

Make staged files readable by the current user without changing permissions across
unrelated raw data.

```bash
# Run on the viewing machine only when transfer is needed; replace example values.
VIEW_ARTIFACT_DIR=/path/to/profile-artifacts/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
mkdir -p "$VIEW_ARTIFACT_DIR/timelines"
scp -r developer@npu-host:/host/path/to/exported_device_directory \
  "$VIEW_ARTIFACT_DIR/timelines/"
```

Preserve rank and device directories to avoid overwriting files with identical names.
Use `sha256sum` on Linux or `shasum -a 256` on macOS; when transferring, compare
source and destination hashes. Record byte counts and hashes even when keeping
files on the server. Raw PROF data may stay in the execution environment; viewing
one rank does not require copying all large files.
